## Sagemaker Ground Truth

Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth helps you build training datasets for machine learning. Ground Truth will label your content (images, audio, text, etc) by guiding a human labeler step-by-step in a process called a workflow. Three groups of humans can provide labels using these workflows: Amazon Mechanical Turk workers, your employees, or third party vendors. Ground Truth can also learn from these labels and label objects automatically.
